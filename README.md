**A production-ready authentication kit that lets you manage the entire authentication system within a single file by copying and pasting the required code.**

### [v1.0.0] - 2024-10-31
- Updated CSS styling to use shadcn defaults for a more primitive kit setup.
- Renamed folders and files and refactored code for a more understandable structure.

# Overview

### Introduction

This is an AuthKit built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com), designed for **production-ready use**. It includes basic UI elements provided with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). Authentication is handled through both Password-based and OAuth methods, following the PKCE flow.

### Teck stacks

- Next.js 14 (React 18) using App Router
- Supabase
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI
- Zod
- Typescript

### Why Next.js 14?

Many packages do not yet support React 19, so I plan to upgrade to Next.js 15 when the timing is appropriate. Apart from asynchronously loading cookies() and searchParams, there are no significant differences in this AuthKit.
